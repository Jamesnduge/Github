## Description

   Git-search is a simple tool that gives a user the ability to search and find any Github user or any Github repository through the help of Github API. The app calls for the specified User or Repository in the API and the API responds with the correct information. The entire application is built in Angular.js

## Prerequisites

  2.  Download and install Angular(a platform that makes it easy to build applications) using the following command >$ npm install -g @angular/cli
  3.  Download and install watchman(an application that watches and records files as they change.)
  5.  Install Typescript(Superset of JavaScript) and its transpiler with the following command $ npm install -g typescript && $ tsc -v -y
